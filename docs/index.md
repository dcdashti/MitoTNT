# MitoTNT - Mitochondrial Temporal Network Tracking
**MitoTNT** is a Python-based pipeline for the tracking, visualization, and dynamic analysis of cellular mitochondrial network data acquired using lattice light-sheet microscopes.  
It is built upon mitochondria segmentation provided by MitoGraph, and visualization engine provided by ChimeraX.  
MitoTNT is written by Zichen (Zachary) Wang, with the help from people in the [Johannes Sch√∂neberg lab](https://www.schoeneberglab.org/) at UCSD.
